## Introduction

MPWLedClock is a simple yet effective project designed to provide a digital clock using the ESP-C3-12F module. It showcases the capabilities of the WS2812 LED matrix for displaying time in a visually appealing way. The project is ideal for both hobbyists and developers looking to explore LED displays and microcontroller programming.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time accurately.
- **Colorful LED Display**: Utilizes WS2812 LEDs for vibrant visuals.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to configure and run.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Efficient use of resources.

## Getting Started

To get started with MPWLedClock, follow the steps outlined below. You can also check the [Releases](https://github.com/linlichuan/MPWLedClock/releases) section for the latest version and updates.

## Hardware Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following hardware:

- **ESP-C3-12F Module**: The core of the project.
- **WS2812 LED Matrix**: For displaying the time.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure your setup has adequate power.
- **Connecting Wires**: For connecting the components.

## Software Requirements

You will need the following software to work with MPWLedClock:

- **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP-C3-12F.
- **ESP32 Board Support**: Install the ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE.
- **Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries for controlling WS2812 LEDs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/linlichuan/MPWLedClock.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**:
   Open the cloned project in your Arduino IDE.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Go to the Library Manager in Arduino IDE and install the required libraries for WS2812.

4. **Configure Your Settings**:
   Adjust any settings in the code as necessary, such as pin numbers or LED count.

5. **Upload the Code**:
   Connect your ESP-C3-12F module to your computer and upload the code from Arduino IDE.
